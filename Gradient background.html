<!--Hue is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360.

Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.

Here are a few examples of using hsl() with fully-saturated, normal lightness colors:

Color	HSL
red	hsl(0, 100%, 50%)
yellow	hsl(60, 100%, 50%)
green	hsl(120, 100%, 50%)
cyan	hsl(180, 100%, 50%)
blue	hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
magenta	hsl(300, 100%, 50%)-->
